## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring, analyzing, and extracting insights from the **Amazon Product Dataset** using Excel and Python. The project demonstrates how to:  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer business questions  
- Apply **AI models from Hugging Face** for sentiment analysis of reviews  
- Build a **basic chatbot** to answer queries about products and insights.

The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights on product performance and customer sentiment while demonstrating AI-assisted analytics.
